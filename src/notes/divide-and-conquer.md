# Divide and conquer

## Definition

Divide and conquer is a problem-solving strategy that involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems, and combining the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.

    The subproblems are similar in structure to the original problem.

## Examples

### Binary search

Binary search is a classic example of the divide-and-conquer strategy. The idea is to divide the array into two halves and recursively search for the target element in one of the halves.

Note: conquer is not needed, is trivial. Im just searching halves and discarding them. The important part is the divide.

### Merge sort

Merge sort is another example of the divide-and-conquer strategy. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the two sorted halves to produce a sorted array.

### Quick sort

Quick sort is another example of the divide-and-conquer strategy. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, partition the array around a pivot element, and then recursively sort the two halves.

### Fibonacci numbers

The Fibonacci numbers can be calculated using the divide-and-conquer strategy. The idea is to divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve the subproblems, and then combine the solutions to solve the original problem.
